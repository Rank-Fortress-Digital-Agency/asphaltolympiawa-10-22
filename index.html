                    Most people know that sealcoating is an essential step in preserving asphalt pavement, but many people don’t realize that sealcoating and asphalt go hand-in-hand. Many contractors will not even consider sealing a driveway if it doesn’t have a fresh coat of blacktop. Here are some reasons why sealcoating and asphalt should always be done together:

                    <a href="https://asphaltolympiawa.com/why-asphalt-is-the-ideal-paving-material-for-commercial-industrial-lots/">Asphalt is a durable material</a>, but it is not impervious to the sun, rain, snow, and ice. Over time, these elements can damage asphalt, causing it to crack and crumble. Sealcoating creates a barrier that protects asphalt from the elements, prolonging its lifespan.

                    Sealcoating is an essential part of maintaining an asphalt surface. It protects against the sun, rain, snow, and ice, damaging asphalt over time. By creating a barrier, sealcoating prolongs the lifespan of asphalt. Sealcoating should be done every two to three years or as needed. It is a relatively simple and inexpensive process that can be done by a professional or do-it-yourselfer.

                    But, what exactly is sealcoating?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sealcoating is the process of applying a protective coating to asphalt to prolong its lifespan and keep it looking fresh and new. This coating acts as a barrier against the sun, rain, snow, and ice, which can damage asphalt over time. Sealcoating should be done every two to three years or as needed. It is a relatively simple and inexpensive process that can be done by a professional or do-it-yourselfer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, if you’re looking to extend the life of your asphalt surface – sealcoat it!

                            Cracks and holes are not only unsightly, but they can also lead to further damage if left unrepaired. Sealcoating fills in these cracks and holes, preventing water from seeping in and causing additional damage.

                        <p>
                            Sealcoating also provides a barrier against sunlight and other elements that can damage your asphalt. Regular sealcoating can help extend the life of your pavement, saving you money in the long run. If you have asphalt pavement that requires repair, contact a professional sealcoating contractor today. They will be able to assess the damage and recommend the best course of action to take.

                            Oxidation occurs when oxygen reacts with the asphalt, causing it to become brittle and dry. The sun’s ultraviolet rays can accelerate this process. Sealcoating creates a barrier that prevents oxygen from contacting the asphalt, slowing oxidation. Sealcoating also protects against the damaging effects of water. Water is one of the leading causes of damage to asphalt. It can cause the asphalt to crack, crumble, and erode. By sealcoating, you create a barrier that keeps water from seeping into the asphalt and causing damage.

                            Sealcoating is an essential part of maintaining your asphalt pavement. It helps to prolong the life of your pavement and keep it looking its best. Sealcoating should be done every two to three years, depending on the amount of traffic your pavement gets and the weather conditions in your area.

                <p>
                    Oil and gas spills are among the most common causes of damage to asphalt pavement. The chemicals in these liquids can eat away at the asphalt, causing it to crack and crumble. Sealcoating provides a barrier that protects against these spills, keeping your pavement looking new for longer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sealcoating also helps to fill in any cracks or small holes that may have already formed in the pavement. This prevents water from seeping into these areas and causing further damage.

                            Pavement that is not sealed is more susceptible to staining from dirt, grease, and other materials. Sealcoating makes it easier to keep your pavement clean, providing a smooth surface that is less likely to absorb stains. Sealcoating is also essential for protecting your pavement from the elements. Unsealed pavement is more likely to crack or chip in extreme weather conditions, whereas sealed pavement is better able to withstand temperature fluctuations and other harsh conditions.

                    A fresh coat of sealcoat can make worn-out asphalt look new again. This can increase the curb appeal of your home or business, making it more attractive to potential buyers or customers. Sealcoating can also help to prevent further deterioration of your asphalt surfaces, protecting your investment. Sealcoat is a protective layer that is applied to asphalt surfaces. This layer helps to prevent water and other elements from seeping into the asphalt, which can cause cracks and further damage. Sealcoat also provides a barrier against sun damage, which can cause the asphalt to fade or become brittle over time.

                <p>
                    Applying a sealcoat is a relatively simple process. First, the surface must be cleaned and any loose debris removed. Then, the sealcoat material is involved in a thin layer using a brush or roller. Once the sealcoat has been applied, it should be allowed to dry for several hours before traffic is allowed on the
